      storyOpening: "This is our story. This is our passion. This is Spinella.",
      story1: "In Sicily, we learned that food is more than sustenance—it's love made visible. It's the way our grandmother welcomed guests with open arms and a full table. It's the laughter that echoed through family dinners that lasted until midnight. It's the soul of an island that has fed the world for centuries.",
      story2: "When we—Salvatore, Marco, and Gabriele—left our homeland to bring this soul to Geneva, people thought we were crazy. \"Geneva already has Sicilian restaurants,\" they said. But we weren't opening just another restaurant. We were creating a home away from home. A place where every guest would feel what we felt growing up: that sharing a meal is sharing your heart.",
      story3: "Today, Spinella is Geneva's top-ranked restaurant. But that's not what makes us proud. What fills our hearts is when a guest tells us, \"I felt like family here.\" Because that's exactly what we set out to create.",

      salvatoreTitle: "The Heart of the Bar",
      salvatoreDesc: "When Salvatore won the highest grade in the history of the European Bartender School in London, his teachers weren't surprised. They'd watched him transform cocktail-making from a technical skill into an art form—not through flashy tricks, but through genuine connection. A great bartender doesn't just mix drinks—he listens, remembers, and makes you feel like the most important person in the room. Trained at Geneva's prestigious Four Seasons Hotel des Bergues and fluent in five languages, Salvatore is a storyteller, a friend, a bridge between cultures. When you sit at Spinella's bar, he'll ask about your day, remember your name, and craft a cocktail that somehow captures exactly what you needed. That's not just skill. That's passion. That's Salvatore.",

Trained at Il Lago (Four Seasons, 1 Michelin star) and with Chef Philippe Chevrier at Domaine de Châteauvieux (2 Michelin stars), he brings world-class technique but never loses sight of what matters: making food that creates happiness. His meticulous nature isn't about perfection—it's about respect for the ingredients and the people who will enjoy them. Every plate is a work of art, prepared with the same care his grandmother taught him in Sicily. As Head Chef and co-manager, Marco ensures that from the first bite to the last, you taste the love. That's Marco.",

The youngest of the three, he works as Sous Chef alongside Marco with the enthusiasm of someone living his dream every day. Trained at Restaurant du Parc des Bastions, Gabriele brings joy and precision to every dish. His tattoo isn't just body art—it's a daily reminder of why they do this: to share the soul of their homeland with every guest. You'll find his touch in the handmade details too: the triangular shape of Sicily on our tasting boards, the handmade wall clock. That's Gabriele.",

C'est la façon dont notre grand-mère accueillait les invités les bras ouverts et la table garnie. C'est le rire des dîners de famille qui duraient jusqu'à minuit. C'est l'âme d'une île qui a nourri le monde pendant des siècles.",
      story2: "Quand nous—Salvatore, Marco et Gabriele—avons quitté notre terre pour en apporter l'âme à Genève, on nous a pris pour des fous. « Genève a déjà des restaurants siciliens », disaient-ils. Mais nous n'ouvrions pas un restaurant de plus. Nous créions une maison loin de la maison. Un lieu où chaque client ressentirait ce que nous avons ressenti en grandissant : que partager un repas, c'est partager son cœur.",
      story3: "Aujourd'hui, Spinella est le restaurant le mieux classé de Genève. Mais ce n'est pas ce qui nous rend fiers. Ce qui nous remplit le cœur, c'est quand un client nous dit : « Je me suis senti comme en famille ici. » Parce que c'est exactement ce que nous voulions créer.",

Un grand barman n'écoute pas qu'il mélange des verres : il écoute, il se souvient, il vous fait sentir la personne la plus importante. Formé au Four Seasons Hotel des Bergues et parlant cinq langues, Salvatore est un conteur, un ami, un pont entre les cultures. Au bar de Spinella, il vous demandera des nouvelles, retiendra votre nom et créera un cocktail qui capture exactement ce dont vous aviez besoin. Ce n'est pas que du talent. C'est de la passion.

Son souci du détail ne relève pas du perfectionnisme ; c'est du respect pour les ingrédients et pour ceux qui vont les déguster. Chaque assiette est une œuvre, préparée avec le même soin que sa grand-mère lui a enseigné en Sicile.

Formé au Restaurant du Parc des Bastions, Gabriele apporte joie et précision à chaque plat. Son tatouage n'est pas qu'un ornement—c'est un rappel quotidien du pourquoi : partager l'âme de leur terre avec chaque client.

È le risate che echeggiavano nei pranzi di famiglia fino a mezzanotte. È l'anima di un'isola che ha nutrito il mondo per secoli.",

Stavamo creando una casa lontano da casa. Un luogo dove ogni ospite avrebbe sentito ciò che abbiamo sentito noi crescendo: che condividere un pasto è condividere il cuore.",

Un grande barman non mescola solo drink: ascolta, ricorda, ti fa sentire la persona più importante. Formatosi al Four Seasons Hotel des Bergues di Ginevra e fluente in cinque lingue, Salvatore è un narratore, un amico, un ponte tra culture.
