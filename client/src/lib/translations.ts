      storyOpening: "This is our story. This is our passion. This is Spinella.",
      story1: "In Sicily, we learned that food is more than sustenance—it's love made visible. It's the way our grandmother welcomed guests with open arms and a full table. It's the laughter that echoed through family dinners that lasted until midnight. It's the soul of an island that has fed the world for centuries.",
      story2: "When we—Salvatore, Marco, and Gabriele—left our homeland to bring this soul to Geneva, people thought we were crazy. \"Geneva already has Sicilian restaurants,\" they said. But we weren't opening just another restaurant. We were creating a home away from home. A place where every guest would feel what we felt growing up: that sharing a meal is sharing your heart.",
      story3: "Today, Spinella is Geneva's top-ranked restaurant. But that's not what makes us proud. What fills our hearts is when a guest tells us, \"I felt like family here.\" Because that's exactly what we set out to create.",

      salvatoreDesc: "When Salvatore won the highest grade in the history of the European Bartender School in London, his teachers weren't surprised. They'd watched him transform cocktail-making from a technical skill into an art form—not through flashy tricks, but through genuine connection. A great bartender doesn't just mix drinks—he listens, remembers, and makes you feel like the most important person in the room. Trained at Geneva's prestigious Four Seasons Hotel des Bergues and fluent in five languages, Salvatore is a storyteller, a friend, a bridge between cultures. When you sit at Spinella's bar, he'll ask about your day, remember your name, and craft a cocktail that somehow captures exactly what you needed. That's not just skill. That's passion. That's Salvatore.",
      marco: "Marco",
      marcoTitle: "The Soul of the Kitchen",
      marcoDesc: "Marco is the brother for whom cooking is a way of sharing joy. He learned his first moves in his grandmother's kitchen in Sicily, then grew up between different culinary worlds: from simple, authentic trattorias to more technical and demanding kitchens. This diversity shaped his outlook, his know-how, and above all his deep respect for the product. Every experience enriched him, but it is in traditional cuisine that he finds his soul—where every gesture respects the simplicity and truth of the ingredients. Marco has that rare ability to extract the essence of an ingredient and turn it into a dish that stays in your memory. With him, you don't just eat: you feel. He creates that magic where, even in Switzerland, you feel as if you're in Italy, in a warm, sincere kitchen inherited from family recipes. As Chef and co-manager, he ensures that every plate carries the same promise: tradition can move you, and cooking can make you happy. That's Marco.",

The youngest of the three, he works as Sous Chef alongside Marco with the enthusiasm of someone living his dream every day. Trained at Restaurant du Parc des Bastions, Gabriele brings joy and precision to every dish. His tattoo isn't just body art—it's a daily reminder of why they do this: to share the soul of their homeland with every guest. You'll find his touch in the handmade details too: the triangular shape of Sicily on our tasting boards, the handmade wall clock. That's Gabriele.",

C'est la façon dont notre grand-mère accueillait les invités les bras ouverts et la table garnie. C'est le rire des dîners de famille qui duraient jusqu'à minuit. C'est l'âme d'une île qui a nourri le monde pendant des siècles.",
      story2: "Quand nous—Salvatore, Marco et Gabriele—avons quitté notre terre pour en apporter l'âme à Genève, on nous a pris pour des fous. « Genève a déjà des restaurants siciliens », disaient-ils. Mais nous n'ouvrions pas un restaurant de plus. Nous créions une maison loin de la maison. Un lieu où chaque client ressentirait ce que nous avons ressenti en grandissant : que partager un repas, c'est partager son cœur.",
      story3: "Aujourd'hui, Spinella est le restaurant le mieux classé de Genève. Mais ce n'est pas ce qui nous rend fiers. Ce qui nous remplit le cœur, c'est quand un client nous dit : « Je me suis senti comme en famille ici. » Parce que c'est exactement ce que nous voulions créer.",

Un grand barman n'écoute pas qu'il mélange des verres : il écoute, il se souvient, il vous fait sentir la personne la plus importante. Formé au Four Seasons Hotel des Bergues et parlant cinq langues, Salvatore est un conteur, un ami, un pont entre les cultures. Au bar de Spinella, il vous demandera des nouvelles, retiendra votre nom et créera un cocktail qui capture exactement ce dont vous aviez besoin. Ce n'est pas que du talent. C'est de la passion.

Il a appris ses premiers gestes dans la cuisine de sa grand-mère en Sicile, puis a grandi entre différents univers culinaires : des trattorias simples et authentiques aux cuisines plus techniques et exigeantes. Cette diversité a façonné son regard, son savoir-faire et surtout son respect profond pour le produit. Chaque expérience l'a enrichi, mais c'est dans la cuisine traditionnelle qu'il retrouve son âme. Celle où chaque geste respecte la simplicité et la vérité des produits. Marco a cette capacité rare d'extraire l'essence d'un ingrédient et de la transformer en un plat qui reste en mémoire. Avec lui, on ne mange pas seulement : on ressent. Il crée cette magie où, même en Suisse, on a l'impression d'être en Italie, dans une cuisine chaleureuse, sincère, héritée des recettes de famille. En tant que Chef et co-gérant, il veille à ce que chaque assiette porte cette même promesse : la tradition peut émouvoir, et la cuisine peut rendre heureux. C'est ça, Marco.",

Formé au Restaurant du Parc des Bastions, Gabriele apporte joie et précision à chaque plat. Son tatouage n'est pas qu'un ornement—c'est un rappel quotidien du pourquoi : partager l'âme de leur terre avec chaque client.

Les trois frères nous ont accueillis avec une telle chaleur, une telle joie sincère, que nous avons oublié être dans un restaurant. Nous étions chez eux, à leur table, nous devenions partie de leur histoire.",
      review2: "J'ai mangé dans des restaurants étoilés Michelin partout dans le monde. Spinella n'a pas d'étoiles, mais il a quelque chose de plus précieux : une âme. On goûte la passion à chaque bouchée. On sent l'amour à chaque interaction. C'est ça, un vrai repas.",
      review3: "Mon mari et moi avons fêté nos 25 ans de mariage chez Spinella. Les frères nous ont fait nous sentir si spéciaux—pas parce que nous leur avions dit que c'était notre anniversaire, mais parce que c'est ainsi qu'ils font sentir tout le monde. Comme si vous comptiez. Comme si votre bonheur était leur mission. Nous n'oublierons jamais cette soirée.",
      review4: "La nourriture était exceptionnelle, oui. Mais ce qui m'a fait monter les larmes aux yeux, c'est de voir Gabriele montrer à mon fils son tatouage de la Sicile et lui expliquer pourquoi il aime tant sa terre. Ce n'est pas quelque chose qu'on peut apprendre au personnel. C'est de la passion authentique.",

È le risate che echeggiavano nei pranzi di famiglia fino a mezzanotte. È l'anima di un'isola che ha nutrito il mondo per secoli.",
      story2: "Quando noi—Salvatore, Marco e Gabriele—abbiamo lasciato la nostra terra per portare quest'anima a Ginevra, dicevano che eravamo pazzi. \"Ginevra ha già ristoranti siciliani.\" Ma non stavamo aprendo un ristorante in più. Stavamo creando una casa lontano da casa. Un luogo dove ogni ospite avrebbe sentito ciò che abbiamo sentito noi crescendo: che condividere un pasto è condividere il cuore.",

Un grande barman non mescola solo drink: ascolta, ricorda, ti fa sentire la persona più importante. Formatosi al Four Seasons Hotel des Bergues di Ginevra e fluente in cinque lingue, Salvatore è un narratore, un amico, un ponte tra culture. Al bar di Spinella ti chiederà della tua giornata, ricorderà il tuo nome e creerà un cocktail che cattura esattamente ciò di cui avevi bisogno. Non è solo talento. È passione. È Salvatore.",

Ha imparato i primi gesti nella cucina della nonna in Sicilia, poi è cresciuto tra mondi culinari diversi: dalle trattorie semplici e autentiche alle cucine più tecniche ed esigenti. Questa diversità ha plasmato il suo sguardo, il suo savoir-faire e soprattutto il suo profondo rispetto per il prodotto. Ogni esperienza lo ha arricchito, ma è nella cucina tradizionale che ritrova la sua anima: quella in cui ogni gesto rispetta la semplicità e la verità dei prodotti. Marco ha quella rara capacità di estrarre l'essenza di un ingrediente e trasformarla in un piatto che resta in memoria. Con lui non si mangia soltanto: si sente. Crea quella magia per cui, anche in Svizzera, si ha l'impressione di essere in Italia, in una cucina calda, sincera, ereditata dalle ricette di famiglia. Come Chef e co-direttore, fa sì che ogni piatto porti la stessa promessa: la tradizione può emozionare e la cucina può rendere felici. È Marco.",

Il suo tatuaggio non è solo body art—è un promemoria quotidiano del perché lo fanno: condividere l'anima della loro terra con ogni ospite.

      review2: "Ho mangiato in ristoranti stellati Michelin in tutto il mondo. Spinella non ha stelle, ma ha qualcosa di più prezioso: l'anima. Si assapora la passione in ogni boccone. Si sente l'amore in ogni interazione. È così che dovrebbe essere pranzare.",

I fratelli ci hanno fatto sentire così speciali—non perché gli avevamo detto che era il nostro anniversario, ma perché è così che fanno sentire tutti. Come se contassi. Come se la tua felicità fosse la loro missione. Non dimenticherò mai quella serata.",
      review4: "Il cibo era eccezionale, sì. Ma ciò che mi ha fatto venire le lacrime agli occhi è stato vedere Gabriele mostrare a mio figlio il suo tatuaggio della Sicilia e spiegargli perché ama tanto la sua terra. Non è qualcosa che si può insegnare al personale. È passione autentica.",

      story1: "In Sizilien haben wir gelernt, dass Essen mehr ist als Nahrung—es ist sichtbar gemachte Liebe. So wie unsere Großmutter Gäste mit offenen Armen und vollem Tisch empfing. Das Lachen bei Familientreffen bis Mitternacht. Die Seele einer Insel, die die Welt seit Jahrhunderten nährt.",
      story2: "Als wir—Salvatore, Marco und Gabriele—unsere Heimat verließen, um diese Seele nach Genf zu bringen, hielten uns viele für verrückt. „Genf hat schon sizilianische Restaurants.“ Aber wir eröffneten nicht einfach ein weiteres Restaurant. Wir schufen ein Zuhause fern der Heimat. Einen Ort, an dem jeder Gast spürt, was wir beim Aufwachsen fühlten: dass ein geteiltes Mahl ein geteiltes Herz ist.",
      story3: "Heute ist Spinella das bestbewertete Restaurant in Genf. Aber darauf sind wir nicht stolz. Was uns erfüllt, ist wenn ein Gast sagt: „Ich habe mich hier wie in der Familie gefühlt.“ Denn genau das wollten wir schaffen.",

Ein großartiger Barkeeper mischt nicht nur Drinks—er hört zu, erinnert sich und lässt Sie sich wie die wichtigste Person fühlen. Ausgebildet im Four Seasons Hotel des Bergues in Genf und fließend in fünf Sprachen, ist Salvatore ein Geschichtenerzähler, ein Freund, eine Brücke zwischen Kulturen. An der Bar von Spinella wird er nach Ihrem Tag fragen, Ihren Namen behalten und einen Cocktail kreieren, der genau das einfängt, was Sie brauchten. Das ist nicht nur Talent. Das ist Leidenschaft. Das ist Salvatore.",

Er lernte seine ersten Handgriffe in der Küche seiner Großmutter in Sizilien und wuchs dann zwischen verschiedenen kulinarischen Welten auf: von einfachen, authentischen Trattorias bis zu anspruchsvolleren Küchen. Diese Vielfalt prägte seinen Blick, sein Know-how und vor allem seine tiefe Achtung vor dem Produkt. Jede Erfahrung hat ihn bereichert, aber in der traditionellen Küche findet er seine Seele – wo jede Geste die Einfachheit und Wahrheit der Zutaten respektiert. Marco hat die seltene Gabe, das Wesen einer Zutat zu extrahieren und in ein Gericht zu verwandeln, das in Erinnerung bleibt. Bei ihm isst man nicht nur: man fühlt. Er schafft diese Magie, bei der man selbst in der Schweiz das Gefühl hat, in Italien zu sein, in einer warmen, aufrichtigen Küche, die von Familienrezepten geerbt wurde. Als Küchenchef und Mitgeschäftsführer sorgt er dafür, dass jedes Gericht dasselbe Versprechen trägt: Tradition kann bewegen, und Kochen kann glücklich machen. Das ist Marco.",

Sein Tattoo ist nicht nur Körperkunst—es ist eine tägliche Erinnerung daran, warum sie das tun: die Seele ihrer Heimat mit jedem Gast teilen.

Es la risa de las cenas familiares hasta medianoche. Es el alma de una isla que ha alimentado al mundo durante siglos.",
      story2: "Cuando nosotros—Salvatore, Marco y Gabriele—dejamos nuestra tierra para llevar esta alma a Ginebra, nos tomaron por locos. \"Ginebra ya tiene restaurantes sicilianos.\" Pero no abríamos un restaurante más. Creábamos un hogar lejos de casa. Un lugar donde cada cliente sentiría lo que sentimos al crecer: que compartir una comida es compartir el corazón.",

Formado en el Four Seasons Hotel des Bergues de Ginebra y con cinco idiomas, Salvatore es un narrador, un amigo, un puente entre culturas. En el bar de Spinella preguntará por tu día, recordará tu nombre y creará un cóctel que capte exactamente lo que necesitabas. No es solo talento. Es pasión. Es Salvatore.",

Aprendió sus primeros gestos en la cocina de su abuela en Sicilia y creció entre distintos universos culinarios: desde trattorias sencillas y auténticas hasta cocinas más técnicas y exigentes. Esta diversidad moldeó su mirada, su saber hacer y sobre todo su profundo respeto por el producto. Cada experiencia lo enriqueció, pero es en la cocina tradicional donde encuentra su alma: aquella en la que cada gesto respeta la sencillez y la verdad de los productos. Marco tiene esa capacidad poco común de extraer la esencia de un ingrediente y transformarla en un plato que queda en la memoria. Con él no solo se come: se siente. Crea esa magia donde, incluso en Suiza, uno tiene la impresión de estar en Italia, en una cocina cálida y sincera heredada de las recetas familiares. Como chef y codirector vela por que cada plato lleve la misma promesa: la tradición puede emocionar y la cocina puede hacer feliz. Eso es Marco.",
