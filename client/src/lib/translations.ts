      storyOpening: "This is our story. This is our passion. This is Spinella.",
      story1: "In Sicily, we learned that food is more than sustenance—it's love made visible. It's the way our grandmother welcomed guests with open arms and a full table. It's the laughter that echoed through family dinners that lasted until midnight. It's the soul of an island that has fed the world for centuries.",
      story2: "When we—Salvatore, Marco, and Gabriele—left our homeland to bring this soul to Geneva, people thought we were crazy. \"Geneva already has Italian restaurants,\" they said. But we weren't opening just another restaurant. We were creating a home away from home. A place where every guest would feel what we felt growing up: that sharing a meal is sharing your heart.",
      story3: "Today, Spinella is the #1-ranked restaurant in Geneva. But that's not what makes us proud. What fills our hearts is when a guest tells us, \"I felt like family here.\" Because that's exactly what we set out to create.",

      salvatoreDesc: "When Salvatore won the highest grade in the history of the European Bartender School in London, his teachers weren't surprised. They'd watched him transform cocktail-making from a technical skill into an art form—not through flashy tricks, but through genuine connection. A great bartender doesn't just mix drinks—he listens, remembers, and makes you feel like the most important person in the room. Trained at Geneva's prestigious Four Seasons Hotel des Bergues and fluent in five languages, Salvatore is a storyteller, a friend, a bridge between cultures. When you sit at Spinella's bar, he'll ask about your day, remember your name, and craft a cocktail that somehow captures exactly what you needed. That's not just skill. That's passion. That's Salvatore.",

His meticulous nature isn't about perfection—it's about respect for the ingredients and the people who will enjoy them. Every plate is a work of art, prepared with the same care his grandmother taught him in Sicily. As Head Chef and co-manager, Marco ensures that from the first bite to the last, you taste the love. That's Marco.",

Trained at Restaurant du Parc des Bastions, Gabriele brings joy and precision to every dish. His tattoo isn't just body art—it's a daily reminder of why they do this: to share the soul of their homeland with every guest.

      review1: "Dès notre arrivée, nous nous sommes sentis comme de vieux amis de retour à la maison. Les trois frères nous ont accueillis avec une telle chaleur, une telle joie sincère, que nous avons oublié être dans un restaurant. Nous étions chez eux, à leur table, nous devenions partie de leur histoire.",
      review2: "J'ai mangé dans des restaurants étoilés Michelin partout dans le monde. Spinella n'a pas d'étoiles, mais il a quelque chose de plus précieux : une âme. On goûte la passion à chaque bouchée. On sent l'amour à chaque interaction. C'est ça, un vrai repas.",
      review3: "Mon mari et moi avons fêté nos 25 ans de mariage chez Spinella. Les frères nous ont fait nous sentir si spéciaux—pas parce que nous leur avions dit que c'était notre anniversaire, mais parce que c'est ainsi qu'ils font sentir tout le monde. Comme si vous comptiez. Comme si votre bonheur était leur mission. Nous n'oublierons jamais cette soirée.",
      review4: "La nourriture était exceptionnelle, oui. Mais ce qui m'a fait monter les larmes aux yeux, c'est de voir Gabriele montrer à mon fils son tatouage de la Sicile et lui expliquer pourquoi il aime tant sa terre. Ce n'est pas quelque chose qu'on peut apprendre au personnel. C'est de la passion authentique.",
